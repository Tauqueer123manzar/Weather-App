# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
Project Description:

I developed a Weather Application using React.js, CSS, and Material-UI.
The application fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API.
It provides a user-friendly interface where users can search for and view current weather conditions for any city.
Deployment Details:

The project is deployed on Vercel for ease of access and seamless performance.
Application URL: Weather Application on Vercel
Additional Notes:

I chose Vercel for deployment due to its reliability and fast deployment process.
Since CodeSandbox is not functioning on my laptop and I have used StackBlitz for other deployments, I utilized Vercel for this project.
